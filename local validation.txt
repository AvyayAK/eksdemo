Port forwarding::
kubectl port-forward svc/stock-api-service 5000:5000


This did the following:
| Action | Result | 
| Forwarded local port 5000 | To the serviceâ€™s target port 5000 | 
| Bound to localhost:5000 | So you could hit the API from your machine | 
| Bypassed ELB/DNS | Let you test the app directly via Kubernetes | 



ðŸ§ª Example Curl During Port Forwarding
curl http://localhost:5000/stock/IBM


This will hit the Flask app inside the cluster, even if we don't have ELB handy.
ðŸ§  When to Use Port Forwarding
- ðŸ”¹ During early testing or debugging
- ðŸ”¹ When you want to bypass external networking
- ðŸ”¹ When working in a private cluster or restricted VPC
- ðŸ”¹ When validating pod-level behavior before exposing it
